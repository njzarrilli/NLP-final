did you know that more and more people these days are depending on computers for their safety natural education and their social life in my opinion the increasing use of computers is not benefiting society initially ones safety while using a computer is at risk to begin when someone is talking to another on a computer they month1 never know who is at the other end of it for example caps1 a small girl was playing a game on the computer and a person began talking to her it could be a predator she will never know unless they meet us somewhere at this point it maybe too late moreover studies show that percent1 of peoples information is more widely exposed in the last num1 years due to the new chat websites such as myspace and facebook in these websites people share their information with this their safety is at risk finally people should stop using computers as much as they are now in order to keep their safety safe furthermore enjoying nature is a must in our world full of immense landscapes wide waters dense forests and lush valleys caps1 you depend on your computer to teach you about the world you should cease this use one must actually be outside experiencing the feel the smell and even the taste of nature a recent study shows that people who actually went to the grand canyon could write a num1 page essay on what they had learned the people who didnt go and simply read information off their computer could not write this much finally society needs to back away from their computers and stop into thirdly a persons social life could be ruined from the use of computers for many reasons one reasons for this could be that a person spends all their time on their computer instead of spending time with their family and friends sure you can chat with people online but thats nothing like chatting in person there is no need to talk to a friend or family member online when you could do it in person finally caps1 someone takes an embarrasing picture of you and puts it on their computer it is there forever thus you can lose friends whether youre the person in the picture or the addict who put the picture on with this you can easily ruin your familysocial life by using your computer too often how would you feel caps1 it was your fault that someones safety is at risk wouldnt you rather enjoy nature in person instead of which it on your computer and not get the fall effect couldnt you talk to your friends and family in person rather than ignore them to use your computer there are numerous ways in which the increasing rate of computer use does not benefit society i encourage you to agree with me that computers can put one safety at risk decrease their education of nature and ruin their social life
